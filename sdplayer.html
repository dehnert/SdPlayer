<h2><a name="L2458" id="L2458"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>SdPlayer is a music player for square dancers. It has all the features you
need for running a workshop (a.k.a. "tape group"), or for playing music for
calling. It is based in the open source VLC media player, so it plays just
about any audio file format you can think of. Here is a summary of its major
features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plays MP3 files, and other audio files (WAV, WMA, etc.) supported by VLC
    on your operating system</li>
  <li>Uses playlist files compatible with Winamp and most other media players
    (M3U playlist format)</li>
  <li>Tape counter with zero, rewind back to zero, history of previous zero
    locations, and undo/redo</li>
  <li>Resumes playback where you left off (last zero location) when playlist is
    opened again</li>
  <li>Tip timer (with sound) to let you know when tip is over, or when new
    dancers should be rotated into square</li>
  <li>Break timer to time the length of breaks</li>
  <li>User configurable keyboard shortcuts for all major functions</li>
  <li>Loop feature to loop a track, or selected portion of a track, ideal for
    callers</li>
  <li>Variable speed playback (changes tempo without changing pitch)</li>
  <li>Windows and Linux versions available</li>
  <li>Free and Open Source</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="L2460" id="L2460"></a>Installation</h2>

<h3><a name="L2462" id="L2462"></a>Windows</h3>

<p>To make SdPlayer run on a Windows computer it is necessary to install three
different items.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install SdPlayer by running the installer SetupSdPlayer200.exe. You must
    have administrative rightts on your computer when running this installer.
    If you are an administrator, simply double-click the installer. If you are
    not an administrator, then right-click the setup file and select "Run as
    administrator" (for windows 7 or 8), or "Run as..." (for Windows XP). You
    can usually just accept all the defaults during the installation process.
    Your computer will beed to be rebooted after the installation. If you
    cannot run the installer as an administrator, you can run it anyway, but
    the path to libvlc will not be added to your system PATH environment
    variable. This will need to be done manually, or SdPlayer will not function
    properly.</li>
  <li>Install the Qt runtile libraries if they are not already installed on
    your computer. The runtime libraries are distributed as a file called
    SetupQt4Lib.exe. Simply double-click this file to install the libraries (if
    they are not already installed on your system).</li>
  <li>Install the free and open source VLC Media Player if it is not already
    installed on your computer. This can be installed by double-clicking the
    vlc-2.1.2-win32.exe file. You can download the latest version of VLC from
    <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">www.videolan.org</a>. The file version
    number may differ as newer versions are released frequently.</li>
</ol>

<p>Important! SdPlayer needs to have a path to the VLC libraries added to your
system PATH environment variable. This is done automatically if you run the
SdPlayer installer as an administrator. If you cannot run the SdPlayer
installer as an administrator, you will need to add this path manually. The
path to the VLC libraries is the same folder where VLC was installed, usually
C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC (for Windows XP) or C:\Program Files
(x86)\VideoLan\VLC (for Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8). To manually modify the
Windows PATH variable, right-click on My Computer and select Properties. Open
the "Advanced" tab and click the "Environment Variables" button. Under "System
variables" is a list of variables. Select the "Path" variable and click the
"Edit" button. Then add the path to your VLC program to the end of the list of
paths listed under "Variable value". Be sure to separate the newly added path
from the other paths with a semicolon (";") character. For example, add your
path to the existing paths as follows (new path highlighted in red):</p>

<p>Was:</p>

<p>%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\any\other\paths</p>

<p>Change to:</p>

<p>%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\any\other\paths<span
style="color:#ff0000">;C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC</span></p>

<p>Note that the existing list of paths might be quite long. Just stick your
path at the end, with a ";" separating it from the other paths. Be sure to
replace C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC in the example above with the actual path
to the VLC player on your computer.</p>

<p>Then reboot your computer to make the new path take effect.</p>

<h3><a name="L2464" id="L2464"></a>Linux</h3>

<p>SdPlayer is distributed as a Debian package file called
sdplayer_v.vv_i386.deb, or as an RPM package called sdplayer-v.vv-p.i386.rpm,
where v.vv is the program version number, and p is the package version number.
Simply double-click the package file to install it, or open the package file
with your package manager. The SdPlayer software is installed in
/usr/share/sdplayer. A script file to launch SdPlayer is installed in /usr/bin.
The initial default configuration "ini" file is installed in
/usr/share/xdg/krubow, and any user configuration settings are saved in
~/.config/krubow. An application menu entry is automatically created, typically
under Sound and Video (or something similar). Your package manager will
automatically install the required VLC library packages and Qt runtime
libraries if these are not already installed on your system. Source files for
SdPlayer are available as a zip file called SdPlayerv.vv.zip.</p>

<p>SdPlayer may be ininstalled using your package manager.</p>

<h2><a name="L2466" id="L2466"></a>Operation</h2>

<h3><a name="L2468" id="L2468"></a>Quick Overview</h3>

<p>When SdPlayer is launched, by default it will open the same playlist file
that was open the last time it was closed, and will resume at the point where
the last zero mark was set. SdPlayer also accepts the name of a sound file or a
playlist file on the command line when it is launched. This means that if a
file is dragged and dropped onto the Windows desktop shortcut for SdPlayer,
SdPlayer will open that sound file or playlist. SdPlayer will also open a sound
file or playlist file by double-clicking the file (if SdPlayer is set as the
default application for that file type), or by selecting "Open with" from your
file browser and selecting SdPlayer in Windows or Linux.</p>

<p>The main SdPlayer window appears as shown.<img alt="main window"
src="mainwindow.png" style="float: right" width="600" height="421"></p>

<p>The title bar shows the name of the currently opened playlist file (if
any).</p>

<p>The menu bar gives access to the <a href="#L2472">File</a>, <a
href="#L2474">Edit</a> and <a href="#L2476">Help</a> menus (described in detail
below).</p>

<p>The Title, Artist and Album fields display the Title, Artist and Album data
from the ID3 tags of the current file.</p>

<p>The Counter shows the position in the current file relative to the last
place the counter was zeroed. Click on the counter to zero it (or use the Zero
shortcut key). SdPlayer keeps a history of every zero mark you have set.
Rewinding will return you to the most recent zero mark. Selecting Undo from the
edit menu or shortcut key will return you to the previous zero mark. Repeated
undo's will return you to earlier zero marks. Selecting Redo from the edit menu
or shortcut key will return you to later zero marks (as long as no additional
zero marks were set).</p>

<p>The Seek Slider indicates the position in the currently playing file. Drag
the slider to quickly seek forward or backward to a new position.</p>

<p>The Buttons give you easy control of the media player. The buttons are (from
left to right) previous track (|&lt;), rewind (&lt;&lt;), skip back (&lt;),
play/pause (P), skip forward (&gt;), and next track (&gt;|). There are also
user selectable shortcut keys for all of these functions (and more). See the
section on <a href="#L2482">Keyboard Shortcuts</a> below for details.</p>

<p>The Playlist shows the list of files to play. The current file is indicated
with a speaker icon (<img alt="playing" src="sound.png" width="16"
height="16">) if it is playing, or a mute icon (<img alt="mute"
src="sound_mute.png" width="16" height="16">) if it is paused. Hovering the
mouse over an entry lets you see the full file path in a pop-up tooltip. You
may drag-and-drop files from your file browser to the playlist to add files.
Drag-and-drop folders to add all the files in the folder to the playlist
(including all nested folders). Note that drag-and-drop is the OLNY way to add
files to the playlist. Drag-and-drop item(s) in the playlist to rearrange the
order. To delete item(s) from the playlist, select them and hit the DEL key.
Finally, double-clicking an item in the playlist causes that file to play. When
selecting items in the playlist, the usual Ctrl and Shift key modifiers may be
used.</p>

<p>The Position field shows the current absolute position in the file, relative
to the start of the file. This position (unlike the Counter) is always from the
start of the file, and is not zeroed when you zero the counter.</p>

<p>The Duration field shows the length of the currently playing file (in
minutes and seconds).</p>

<p>The Loop Mode checkbox indicates if the file should be played in loop mode.
Loop mode will repeatedly play the entire file (if no start/end times have been
set), or will repeat the selected portion from start to end (if start/end times
have been set). See the section on <a href="#L2478">Loops</a> below for details
on setting up loops.</p>

<p>The Tip Timer indicates the time left. The length of the timer is set in the
<a href="#L2480">Options</a> dialog (see below). The timer starts running
automatically when a file starts playing. To pause the timer, simply click on
the Tip Timer (or use the Timer shortcut key). Click a second time to reset the
timer to its starting value. When the timer counts down to zero, the timer
alert sound will play (if one has been set), and the Tip Timer background will
turn red. The Tip Timer display is also used for the Breaktimer. When the break
timer is active, the background color of the timer will be yellow. When the
break timer expires, SdPlayer automatically executes a play/pause command to
either start or stop the music.</p>

<p>The Volume slider sets the playback volume. When you close SdPlayer it
remembers the volume setting, so the next time you start SdPlayer the volume
will be right where you left it. The volume may be set from 0 to 200%. Normally
the volume should not be set above 100%, since setting it above 100% can cause
clipping and distortion. However, if the file that is playing was recorded at a
low level, setting the volume above 100% can give some needed volume boost, and
may not cause distortion.</p>

<p>You can click-and-drag the Resize handle in the lower-right corner of the
window (or drag the edges of the window) to resize the main window (or any
other window) in SdPlayer. This is handy to be able to view more items in the
playlist, for example, without having to scroll.</p>

<h3><a name="L2470" id="L2470"></a>Menus</h3>

<h4><a name="L2472" id="L2472"></a>File Menu</h4>

<p>The File menu contains the following entries:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Open...</dt>
    <dd>Opens a dialog box for selecting a playlist file to open. Note that if
      the previous playlist has been modified, you will first be asked if you
      want to save the changes you made.</dd>
  <dt>Save</dt>
    <dd>Saves the current playlist.</dd>
  <dt>SaveAs...</dt>
    <dd>Saves the current playlist under a new name.</dd>
  <dt>Close</dt>
    <dd>Closes the current playlist file and empties the playlist. Note that if
      the playlist has been modified, you will first be asked if you want to
      save the changes you made.</dd>
  <dt>Exit</dt>
    <dd>Exits the program. Note that if the playlist has been modified, you
      will first be asked if you want to save the changes you made. The next
      time you start SdPlayer it will automatically open the playlist that was
      open (if any) when you closed it.</dd>
</dl>

<h4><a name="L2474" id="L2474"></a>Edit Menu</h4>

<p>The edit menu contains the following entries:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Undo</dt>
    <dd>This erases the current Zero mark, and rewinds back to the Zero mark
      that had been set before that. In other words, it goes back one level in
      the history list of Zero marks.</dd>
  <dt>Redo</dt>
    <dd>This restores the last Zero mark that was erased by Undo. Note that a
      Redo is only possible if you have not set any new Zero marks. Once you
      zero the counter, redo will not be able to restore any more "undone" zero
      marks.</dd>
  <dt>Speed...</dt>
    <dd>This opens the Speed dialog box which has a slider for setting the
      playback speed from 75% to 125% of normal speed. This alters the tempo
      without changing the pitch. The speed always defaults to 100% when
      SdPlayer is launched.</dd>
  <dt>Breaktimer...</dt>
    <dd>This opens the Breaktimer dialog box for starting the break timer. See
      the section on Breaktimer below for details.</dd>
  <dt>Loop...</dt>
    <dd>This opens the Edit Loop dialog box for setting start/end points for
      looping the current file. See the section on <a href="#L2478">Loops</a>
      below for details.</dd>

    <dd>This opens the Shortcuts dialog box for setting keyboard shortcuts. See
      the section on <a href="#L2482">Keyboard Shortcuts</a> below for
    details.</dd>
</dl>

<h4><a name="L2476" id="L2476"></a>Help Menu</h4>

<p>The help menu contains the following entries:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Help</dt>
    <dd>Displays the SdPlayer help file in your browser.</dd>

    <dd>Displays the About box showing program version number and contact
      information.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="L761" id="L761"></a>Breaktimer</h3>

<p>SdPlayer has a convenient timer for timing the length of breaks. Select the
Edit-&gt;Breaktimer... menu entry (or press the BreakTimer shortcut key) to
open the Breaktimer dialog box, which appears as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="Breaktimer" src="breaktimer.png" width="201" height="161"
style="float: right;"></p>

<p>Simply move the slider to select the length of the timer from 0.0 to 10.0
minutes in 0.1 minute steps. You may also click the up/down arrows to the right
of the time, or type in a time. Click OK to start the break timer, or Cancel to
discard your changes. The timer on the main window will begin counting down the
length of the break you selected. Note that the background color of the timer
is yellow while it is being used as a break timer. When the timer expires, a
play/pause command is automatically executed. This will cause the music to
start playing (if it was stopped), or to stop playing (if it was already
playing), to indicate that the break is over. The length of the break timer is
remembered, and will be the same the next time you open the break timer dialog
box, although it is not remembered when SpPlayer is closed.</p>

<h3><a name="L2478" id="L2478"></a>Loops</h3>

<p>SdPlayer has two ways to play a file in a loop. It can either loop the
entire file, or it can loop a selected portion of the file (from a start point
to an end point). If a start and end point has been set for a file, that
selection will be looped. If no start or end point has been set it will loop
the entire file.</p>

<p>The start and end points are set using the Edit-&gt;Loop... menu entry. But
before opening the Edit Loop dialog box, it is best to mark the desired start
and end points while playing the file. This is done quite simply by setting a
Zero mark (i.e zeroing the counter) at the desired loop start point, and
setting a second Zero mark at the desired loop end. Note that you can always
Undo the loop end Zero mark and set it again if you need to adjust its position
before creating the loop. Setting Zero marks is very easy to do by using a
keyboard shortcut while listening to the file play. Once you have set a Zero
mark at the loop start and end points, pause the playback and select
Edit-&gt;Loop... to open the Edit Loop dialog box, which appears as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="Edit Loop" src="editloop.png" style="float: right" width="273"
height="212"></p>

<p>The Loop Start and Loop End times are shown in milliseconds. For example, a
loop start time of 10.3 seconds would be shown as 10300, and a loop end time of
2 minutes 45.7 seconds would be shown as 165700 (2 minutes 45.7 seconds is
165.700 seconds).</p>

<p>Click the Set Start button to set the Loop Start time to the Zero mark you
set earlier for the loop start time (i.e. the second to last zero mark that you
set). Click the Set End button to set the Loop End time to the Zero mark you
set earlier for the loop end time (i.e. the last zero mark that you set). The
times will be shown in the dialog box. Click OK to accept these times. The loop
start/end times will be written into a file with the same name as the MP3 file,
but with a file type of ".loop". You can adjust the loop start/end times any
time by opening the Edit Loop dialog box and setting new start/end times, or
changing the start/end times. You can type in new times, adjust the times by
clicking the up and down arrows to the right of the times (this changes the
times in steps of 10 milliseconds), or by draging the sliders under the start
and end times (for making coarse adjustments anywhere from the start to the end
of the file). Note that you can also use another application, such as an audio
editor, to determine your loop start and end times. Simply convert the times
from your audio editor into milliseconds and type the numbers into the Edit
Loop dialog box.</p>

<p>To delete the loop start/end information for an MP3 file, simply delete the
associated ".loop" file. For example, to delete the loop information for My
Music/Square Dance/Turkey in the Straw.mp3, just delete the file My
Music/Square Dance/Turkey in the Straw.loop.</p>

<h3><a name="L2480" id="L2480"></a>Options</h3>

<p>Select Edit-&gt;Oprions... to open the options dialog box. It appears as
follows:</p>
<img alt="options" src="options.png" style="float: right" width="244"
height="265"> 

<p>Tip Timer is the length of the tip timer in minutes. Set it to zero to
disable the tip timer.</p>

<p>Tip Sound is a sound file to play when the tip timer expires. This can be
any audio file type that VLC can play. Click the Browse button to select a file
to play. Leave Tip Sound blank to disable the tip timer sound.</p>

<p>Tip Volume sets the volume of the tip timer sound from 0% to 100%. The Tip
Timer volume is set independently of the music volume, and is not affected by
the main volume control.</p>

<p>Back Time is the time (in seconds) to automatically back up each time you
pause the playback. This avoids missing an important word when playback is
resumed. Backing up a second or two is usually enough.</p>

<p>Skip Time is the time to skip forward and backward when using the skip back
and forward buttons or keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>Volume Step determines the amount to raise or lower the music volume when
using the volume up and volume down shortcut keys. The total volume range is
0-200%, so a step size of 10 means there are 10 steps from no volume to 100%
volume.</p>

<h3><a name="L2482" id="L2482"></a>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>SdPlayer has fully user customizable keyboard shortcuts for all major
functions. Select Edit-&gt;Shortcuts... to open the shortcuts dialog box. It
appears as follows:</p>
<img alt="shortcuts" src="shortcuts.png" style="float: right" width="293"
height="166"> 

<p>There is a list of Key/Action pairs. Key tells which key has been assigned
to perform the action. The key may optionally have modifiers of Ctrl, Shift
and/or Alt to indicate that the designated modifier key(s) must be held down at
the same time the shortcut key is pressed. Action tells what action is to be
performed when the shortcut key is pressed. Available actions are as
follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Back</dt>
    <dd>Skip backward by the skip time set in options. Note that this will
      seamlessly skip back across track boundaries if necessary.</dd>
  <dt>BreakTimer</dt>
    <dd>Opens the Breaktimer dialog box to set the time for, and start the
      break timer.</dd>
  <dt>Forward</dt>
    <dd>Skip forward by the skip time set in options. Note that this will
      seamlessly skip forward across track boundaries if necessary.</dd>
  <dt>Loop</dt>
    <dd>Toggles Loop mode on and off.</dd>
  <dt>NextTrack</dt>
    <dd>Advances to the next track in the playlist.</dd>
  <dt>PlayPause</dt>
    <dd>Toggles between Play and Pause. Note that pausing will automatically
      back up by the Back Time set in options.</dd>
  <dt>PrevTrack</dt>
    <dd>Backs up to the previous track in the playlist.</dd>
  <dt>Redo</dt>
    <dd>Restores one zero mark previously deleted by an Undo. Redo Only works
      if no new Zero marks have been set since the last Undo.</dd>
  <dt>Rewind</dt>
    <dd>Rewinds back to the last Zero mark that was set.</dd>
  <dt>Timer</dt>
    <dd>Stops the timer (if it was running), or resets the timer back to its
      starting value (if the timer was already stopped). The timer starts
      automatically when a file starts playing.</dd>
  <dt>Undo</dt>
    <dd>Deletes the most recently set Zero mark, and rewinds back to the Zero
      mark that was set before that one.</dd>
  <dt>VolumeDown</dt>
    <dd>Turns the volume down by one volume step (as set in options).</dd>
  <dt>VolumeUp</dt>
    <dd>Turns the volume up by one volume step (as set in options).</dd>
  <dt>Zero</dt>
    <dd>Zeros the counter by setting a Zero mark at the current play position.
      You may instantly return to this zero mark with Rewind. Note that
      SdPlayer also automatically sets a zero mark at the beginning of a track
      when the new track starts to play. This is done so the counter starts at
      zero when a new track starts playing.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To delete a shortcut, simply select it and click the Delete button. To add a
new shortcut, click the Add... button to open the Shortcut dialog box, which
appears as follows:</p>
<img alt="shortcut" src="shortcut.png" style="float: right" width="198"
height="164"> 

<p>To add a new shortcut, simply select the desired shortcut key from the Key
dropdown list box, and select the desired action from the Action dropdown list
box. Check any modifier key(s) you want, and click OK. Note that is is
perfectly acceptable to assign more than one shortcut key to the same action.
The default shortcut keys are assigned as follows (note that some actions have
multiple shortcut keys for compatibility with old versions of Wplayer).</p>

<h2><a name="L712" id="L712"></a>Customizing Supported File Types</h2>

<p>To change the list of file types supported by SdPlayer, simply edit the text
file "filetypes.txt" which you can find in the folder where SdPlayer was
installed. This file contains a list of supported file types, with one file
type listed per line. Note that the VLC player libraries must already support
any file types you list in this file. Editing filetypes.txt simply changed what
file types SdPlayer will allow you to add to a playlist. A codec must already
be installed to allow SdPlayer to actually play the file. The file type "mp3"
will always be allowed whether of not it is included in filetypes.txt.</p>

<p>By default, the supported file types are aac, ac3, amr, ape, dts, flac, mod,
mp1, mp2, mp3, ogg, opus, ra, tta, wav, wma, wv and xm.</p>

<p>Any audio file type supported by VLC media player will work with SdPlayer as
long as the file type is listed in the filetypes.txt file.</p>
